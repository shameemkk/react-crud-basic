# CRUD Operations in React

## Overview
This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using React. It allows users to manage a list of users with basic information such as name, phone, email, and address. The application interacts with a fake API provided by [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to simulate real-world data operations.

## Features
- **Create User**: Add a new user to the list.
- **Read Users**: View the list of users with their details.
- **Update User**: Edit the details of an existing user.
- **Delete User**: Remove a user from the list.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used for the application logic.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JSONPlaceholder**: A fake online REST API for testing and prototyping.
